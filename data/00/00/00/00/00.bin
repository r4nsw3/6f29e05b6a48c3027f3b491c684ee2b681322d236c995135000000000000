  |   The 50s, New York City: Joe Dunn, owner of a boxing club, is found    |
  |   dead.                                                                 |

  |   Meanwhile, rising star Bobby Yale, due to take to the ring for the    |
  |   most important fight of his career, has mysteriously disappeared.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Sonia Dunn, Joe's daughter, takes over the gym and must deal with     |
  |   its financial woes. She hires private detective John Blacksad to      |
  |   investigate Yale's disappearance. This sinister case will take our    |
  |   investigator to the darkest, most dismal depths of New York.          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With its anthropomorphic characters and its incredible 1950s feel,    |
  |   BLACKSAD: Under the Skin promises all the eerily dark adventure of    |
  |   a detective novel, just like the eponymous comic book series.         |

  |   Conduct the investigation in your own way. Make use of your feline    |
  |   senses as you hunt for new clues. Make decisions on behalf of         |
  |   Blacksad and influence the outcome of the case.                       |
